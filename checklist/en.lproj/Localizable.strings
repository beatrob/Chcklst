This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Chcklst unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way. The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

**Log Data**

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

**Service Providers**

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

• To facilitate our Service;
• To provide the Service on our behalf;
• To perform Service-related services; or
• To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Children’s Privacy**

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

"terms_and_conditions_title" = "Terms & Conditions";
"terms_and_conditions_text" = "By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Robert Konczi.

Robert Konczi is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The Chcklst app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Chcklst app won’t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Robert Konczi will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Robert Konczi cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Robert Konczi cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Robert Konczi cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Robert Konczi’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Robert Konczi accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Robert Konczi does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

**Changes to This Terms and Conditions**

I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-09-26

"help_checklists_text" = "With Checklists you can significantly improve your productivity. Creating a shopping, a to-do, a backpack or other types of lists is very easy and straight-forward using Chcklst.

**Creating a Checklist**

Start to create your Checklist by tapping the “+” button on your dashboard. Next, you can choose to create a new empty list, or you can use one of your Templates created earlier (you can read more about Templates on the Help page)

When creating a new list from scratch you can enter a title and a description. Then you can add as many items as you want, or you can leave the items empty, and fill them later.

Before creating a new Checklist you can choose to set a reminder to get notified when things are needed to be done. To set a reminder you have to enable push notifications, when prompted select “Allow”, or you can enable it later in the Settings menu.

You can check the “Save as Template” checkbox to create a new Template from your new list. The Checklist title, description and all the items will be copied to the new Template so you can reuse it later.

After your new Checklist is created you will be prompted to the dashboard, where the checklists are displayed with the title and the items done/undone ratio. The first undone item in your list is also visible under the title.

**Using Checklists**

You can open a Checklist from the dashboard. By tapping the bullet icon on before each item you can set the item done or undone. Done items are marked with a check-mark, their text is crossed out and are moved to the bottom of the list. By un-checking, the item will be moved back to the top of the list.

**Editing & Deleting Checklists**

You can edit a Checklist by long-pressing on it’s title on the dashboard, then select “Edit” from the bottom action sheet, select “Delete” to remove your list (this operation is not reversible). You can achieve the same results from the Cheklist detail page by tapping the “...” icon on the navigation bar.

**Creating Templates**

You can create Templates from existing or new Checklists on the dashboard. You can also create new Templates from scratch.

**Using Templates**

Your Templates can be accessed from the side-menu, by tapping the “Templates” button. Here you can edit, or delete your existing Templates. On this screem it’s also possible to create new Checklists and Schedules (read more about Schedules on the Help page).

**Creating Schedules**

Schedules can be created from existing Templates. Start with selecting a Template from the list. Next you can change the Schedule’s title & description, these are prefilled from the template. As a last step you have to set the Schedule date and time when your new Checklist is going to be created. It’s also possible to set a repeat frequency of you Schedule. This will ensure that your checklist will be created repeatedly in the given time interval.

**Using Schedules**

Your planned Schedules are visible in the “Schedules” page where you can edit, delete or re-schedule them. Expired or used Schedules are automatically deleted.
